        Project 3 was a semester long project that was done in fulfillment of my Intro to Engineering class.
        This class was taken during FALL 2016.
        During the second half of the semester, students were divided into groups of 4 or 5 students per group.
        The problem statement for this project is that in order to accomodate the growing population in Sparkyville city,
        a new method of transportation needed to be developed to reduce the high pollution and congestion on the roads.
        <br><br>
        The requirements for this project includes it must be powered by renewable energy,
        be self operating with a manual operating option, be able to hold at least three people including a driver, as well as meet our budget.
        My team chose factors for transportation to be cost effective, luxurious, durable, able to drive at high speeds, low in weight, and finally, high in safety rating.
        <br>

    <h2 id="p1-challenges"> Challenges</h2>
    <p class="p1-challenges">
        Challenges we faced as a team includes time management and indecisiveness.
        In the beginning everyone was still getting to know each other since this is a freshmen class.
        Not long into the semester, we realized that we have an indecisive nature.
        We were given many materials to choose from.
        Since all of us had not much experience with these materials, we wanted to test out each of the materials.
        But time ran short and we had to come to a conclusion quick in order to get the building phase of the project done.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p1-conclusion"> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="p1-conclusion">
        If given more time, we would change the wooden dowel to an aluminium dowel to reduce friction. 
        We would also do further testing for the number of solar panels and types of circuit the solar panels were to be connected. 
        Currently the vehicle barely moves with passengers on board. 
        We would also soder the connecting wires to ensure circuit is in best contact preventing random cut in circuit. 
        Also we would add a second motor to increase the torque thus, enabling the vehicle to move.
