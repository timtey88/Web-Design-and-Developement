    <p class="p1-description">
        Project 5 was a semester long project that was done in fulfillment of my Modern Separations class.
        This class was taken during SPRING 2019.
        <br><br>
        The project scope includes determining the appropriate property methods such as UNIFAC, NRTL, Margules, and much
        more.
        This task is given to the property manager and will have a heavy load initially.
        The second part would be tasked to the process modeler.
        This task includes using ChemCAD to run separate scenarios for each property method chosen for comparison.
        Comparison includes factors such as partial or total reboiler or condenser, steam injection, multiple towers,
        and more.
        The third part of this project would be task as the economist of this project.
        The economist will generate a spreadsheet to analyze the costs and benefits of each option chosen by the process
        modeler.
        The final part of this project would be tasked as the reporter.
        This person must be exact and aware of all of the formatting requirements mentioned by the professor.

    <h2 id="p1-challenges"> Challenges</h2>
    <p class="p1-challenges">
        Challenges we faced as a team in this project would include time management.
        This project was given only about a month to complete.
        During the first week, we spent the time to go through the work load and divide up the work.
        The second week, we had many midterms, hence the project was delayed and most work on the project was pushed
        back.
        During the third week, we realized time was running out as the parts that were divided needed to be done in
        progession.
        The four parts needed to be completed one after another since it builds of the results of the previous work.
        Thus, our group had to help out one another a little for the first two parts to get the project going.
        All in all we were just inexperienced and needed some guidaince in project management.
