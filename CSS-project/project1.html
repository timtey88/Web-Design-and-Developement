		<h2 class="project-title">Physics Project</h2>
		<p class="p1-description">
			Project 1 was a year long accumulation of projects that was done in fulfillment of my Honors Engineering Physics I and II classes.
			These classes were taken during FALL 2015 and SPRING 2016. 
			During the first semester, there were a total of 5 projects that were given to us students. 
			While the second semester only 4 projects were given.
			Thus, the total projects within the two semesters were 9 projects. 
			These projects were all done using Wolfram Mathematica 10.3 as requested by the professor.
			<br><br>
			The projects given in during these two semesters have primarily two goals in mind. 
			Firstly, the professor intended to introduced students to a simple programming software. 
			By learning a simple programming software, students are now able to solve problems involving more realistic parameters. 
			By doing so, I learnt how to use the basics of Mathematica and to be able to visualize problems and solutions.

		<h2 id="p1-challenges"> Challenges</h2>
		<p class="p1-challenges">
			There were many challenges that I faced during that year. 
			One of the first challenges I faced was learning to code on MATLAB. 
			That was the first time I was exposed to basic coding. 
			It was a hard struggle for weeks before understanding the basics. 
			By then the difficulty of the course had increased exponentially. 
			Not only I had to learn how to code, I also had to learn the new course materials. 
			Before any coding could be done, I would have to solve the problem by hand or at least draft out the layout of how I would solve the problem. 
			With these challenges adding up one after another, I was able learn much more in these classes.
