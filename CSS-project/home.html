			Hello all,
			<br><br>
			<em><i>Welcome to my Project Folio!</i></em>
			<br><br>
			This is a project folio of projects I have done or was involved in. 
			These projects are a timeline of projects done in my college years. 
			<br><br>
			The reason for making this project folio is to keep a detail and organize record of all my past projects. 
			This will also help me keep track of any new and upcoming projects that I might be involved in. 
			As more projects are completed, I will update this project folio. 
			<br><br>
			The other reason for making this project folio is to display my skills for hiring managers and recruiters. 
			This way the any future employers, partners, or interested users can better gauge my ability to fit their needs.
