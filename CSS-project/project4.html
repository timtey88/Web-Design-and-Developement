    <h2 id="p1-description"> Adiabatic Burning of Carbon Monoxide</h2>
    <p class="p1-description">
        Project 4 was a semester long project that was done in fulfillment of my Numerical Methods class.
        This class was taken during SPRING 2017.
        In the problem statement, there is a water gas plant burning with air in an adiabatic reactor that produces carbon monoxidde.
        Students are required to obtain numerical solutions to two non-linear algebraic equations.
        Besides that, a mathematical model and numerical solution procedure are to be reported in this project.
        <br><br>
        The assumptions for this project are the combustion occurs at constant atmospheric pressure, and
        the provided standard states for all components are given at 1 atm.
        Additionally, for simplicity the pressure inside the reactor is 1 atm,
        all components are pure gases that are in line with the given information regarding standard states.
        Finally, the oxygen to carbon monoxide ratio is constant and the pressure of the system is also constant.

    <h2 id="p1-challenges"> Challenges</h2>
    <p class="p1-challenges">
        Challenges we faced as a team was dividing up the work load equally.
        Each student has a different schedule and planning a time to meet up proved to be difficult.
        Fortunately, each of us were capable of completing the tasked that were given to each one.
        Truthfully, there were a couple of times in the beginning where we would communicate only through messaging applications.
        Not too long after, we decided that it would be a lot more efficient to meet up for certain things.
        All in all, we managed to pull through with the project completed.
