		<p class="p1-description">
			Project 2 was a semester long project that was done in fulfillment of my Intro to Engineering class.
			This class was taken during FALL 2016.
			During the first half of the semester, students were divided into groups of 4 or 5 students per group.
			The problem statement for this project is that emergency crews need a faster, andmore efficient delivery system for supplies.
			In order to solve this problem, the task was to design and build a delivery system representedby the ping pong launcher.
			<br><br>
			The requirements for this project includes the accuracy, durability, adjustibility, weight, cool factor, stability, and simplicity.
			After completing the design matrix we came to a conclusion that accuracy would be themain criterias for our design and build.
			<br>
		</p>
		<h2 id="p1-challenges"> Challenges</h2>
		<p class="p1-challenges">
			There were challenges that me and my team faced during the designing and building phase of this project.
			The greatest challenge would be trying to determine the type of material and dimensions of the launcher.
			Since the project dateline was still far ahead, we did a simple trial run of each of the plausible ideas thrown out by the team.
